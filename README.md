# pgm
> Simple tests on PGM based image processing

## Objectives

* write a program capable of read, write and generate simple pgm images
* write fuctions capable of manipulating these images
  * noise reduction
  * geometric description of circles

### Plan of implementation: first stage
  - [x] generate a noisy image of a circle
    - [x] draw a circle by giving parameters
    - [x] apply noise filter
  - [x] generate and remove greyscale noise
    - [x] normalization
    - [x] binarization
  - [ ] obtain multiple circle geometry
    - [ ] absolute position of center
    - [ ] absolute description of border
    - [ ] relative positioning
    - [ ] collisions?
