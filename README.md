# pgm
> Simple tests on PGM based image processing

## Objectives

* write a program capable of read, write and generate simple pgm images for future data visualization
* write fuctions capable of manipulating these images
  * normalization
  * binarization
  * geometric description of circles
  * in the future: geometric aproximation of shapes of interest

### Plan of implementation: first stage
  - [x] remove greyscale noise
    - [x] normalization
    - [x] binarization
  - [ ] obtain multiple circle geometry
    - [ ] absolute position of center
    - [ ] absolute description of border
    - [ ] relative positioning
    - [ ] collisions?

## Methods
  * usage of greyscale of netbpm standard (pgm) and Gimp
  * implementation in C using Linux standard libraries

## Results
